For each Linux version, the source code is extracted from Linus git tree
with something like:

$ git --work-tree=./src/v2.6.11 checkout v2.6.11 -- .

The total size is around 25G for all versions between v2.6.11 and v4.1.
But you can reduce it to 15G by running hard-link-dupes.sh after cloning
the repository. Read hard-link-dupes.sh for some warnings.

Folders and files:

linux     - Linus tree as a git submodule

sloccount - one text file with output from sloccount for each Linux version
            since v2.6.11. The files are here as it takes a lot of time to
            generate the files and  it is not easy to run sloccount in
            parallel.

src       - one folder for each Linux version since v2.6.11.

README    - This file.

hard-link-dupes.sh - script that convert duplicate files into hard links.
                     Can save 10G+ of disk space but read the warnings on
                     the scripts before using it.

update.sh - script that keep everuthing up to date.
