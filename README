For each Linux version, the source code is extracted from Linus git tree
with something like:

$ git --work-tree=./src/v2.6.11 checkout v2.6.11 -- .

Folders and files:

src       - one folder for each Linux version since v2.6.11

sloccount - one text file with output from sloccount for each Linux version
            since v2.6.11 It takes a lot of time to generate the files and
            it is not easy to run sloccount in parallel

update.sh - script that keep everuthing up to date
