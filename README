For each Linux version, the source code is extracted from Linus git tree
with something like:

$ git --work-tree=./src/v2.6.11 checkout v2.6.11 -- .

The total size is around 24G for all versions between v2.6.11 and v4.1.
But you can reduce it to 11G by running hard-link-dupes.sh after cloning
the repository. Read hard-link-dupes.sh for some warnings.

Folders and files:

linux     - Linus tree as a git submodule

linuxes-data - external repository with data I'm collecting on the source
               code. Some GB of stuff like sloccount and some semantic
               information

src       - one folder for each Linux version since v2.6.11.

src/unique_file_list - text file containing a list of repeated files. The
                       number of lines equals the number of unique files
                       and for each line, multiple files with same content
                       are separeted by a pipe "|". This file is generated
                       by unique_file_list.py but it only works after
                       running hard-link-dupes.sh

README    - This file.

hard-link-dupes.sh - script that convert duplicate files into hard links.
                     Can save 10G+ of disk space but read the warnings on
                     the script before using it.

unique_file_list.py - Creates the file src/unique_file_list. Identical
                      files are identified by the inode number. This
                      works as hard links are created by
                      hard-link-dupes.sh

update.sh - script that keep everuthing up to date.
